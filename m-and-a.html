      <h1>M&A Structuring Module</h1>
      <p>
        This module provides a structured environment for mergers, acquisitions,
        and strategic equity participation using existing operating entities.
        The focus is continuity, governance clarity, and defensible execution —
        independent of sector.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section>
      <h2>Structure Before Transaction</h2>
      <p>
        Most failed or delayed transactions are not caused by poor assets or
        misaligned parties, but by fragmented documentation, unclear governance,
        and disrupted banking continuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module addresses those issues before capital is introduced.
      </p>
