  <h1>Strategic Access & Control Framework</h1>
  <p><em>A Long-Term, Low-Friction Alternative to Account Leasing and Legal Trusteeship</em></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This framework enables capital deployment through existing operating companies
    while preserving control, continuity, and long-term efficiency — without relying
    on informal trust, account leasing, or high-cost legal gatekeeping.
  </p>
  <p>
    The objective is simple: provide durable control and flexibility over a 20-year
    horizon while aligning incentives and minimizing structural leakage.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Core Issue This Framework Solves</h2>
  <p>
    Foreign and large-scale investors repeatedly face three risks when deploying capital
    through third-party entities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of control over funds</li>
    <li>Ongoing cost leakage tied to cash movement rather than value creation</li>
    <li>Operational friction caused by legal or administrative bottlenecks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Many proposed solutions feel safe upfront but become inefficient over time.
    This framework addresses those risks structurally.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Three Common Structures</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Option A — Account Leasing (Rejected)</strong>
      <p>Continuous percentage costs, misaligned incentives, and no enforceable control.</p>
      <p><em>Efficient short-term, unsustainable long-term.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Option B — Lawyer or Trustee Control (Rejected)</strong>
      <p>Operational delays, compounding fees, and restricted execution speed.</p>
      <p><em>Legally safe, operationally restrictive.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Option C — Equity with Governance (Preferred)</strong>
      <p>Legal control, aligned incentives, and clean scalability over decades.</p>
      <p><em>The only structure that supports 20-year deployment.</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How Control Is Preserved</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> defined signing rights and thresholds</li>
    <li><strong>Authority:</strong> board resolutions and shareholder agreements</li>
    <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> reporting and governance, not daily interference</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This removes the need for blind trust, informal arrangements, or continuous legal mediation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Where Quintrin Fits</h2>
  <p>
    Quintrin does not hold funds, operate accounts, or act as trustee.
    Our role is limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structural design</li>
    <li>Sequencing of control transfer</li>
    <li>Governance continuity</li>
    <li>Neutral oversight across parties</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Quintrin participates only when value is created — not when money moves.
  </p>

  <h2>Speed of Execution vs Risk Exposure</h2>

  <p>
    Structural choice does not only affect long-term cost and control —
    it directly determines how quickly capital can be deployed when timing matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Informal leasing arrangements often appear fast, but introduce uncontrolled
    counterparty risk. Legal trusteeship reduces risk, but materially slows execution.
    Equity-based governance provides the only structure where speed and risk
    improve together over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    As governance matures, decision latency decreases while legal and operational
    risk compress — enabling decisive action without dependency on intermediaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Positioning Statement</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      “Equity participation is not about buying businesses.
      It is about removing friction, aligning incentives, and protecting capital over time.
      It is cheaper than rent, safer than trust, and more flexible than legal control.”
