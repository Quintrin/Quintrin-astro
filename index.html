    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        Quintrin Financial Services Ltd is a privately held Trinidad-based consultancy and execution-focused company specializing in asset optimization, operational turnaround, and value creation across diverse sectors.

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY / APPROACH -->
    <section id="philosophy">
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        While Quintrin operates primarily as a strategic consultancy, we structure each engagement independently, assembling the appropriate expertise, labor, and resources required for the specific scope of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach allows us to move efficiently across industries while maintaining accountability and results-driven delivery.

      <h2>Our Guiding Principle</h2>
